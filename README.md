# Sample Flask Login Page

# Here I started working on my first Python Website. I will expand it further step by step :).

# To test it run it on your localhost, don't forget 'static' and 'templates' should be in the same directory as main.py. Run this in your current directory:
     python3 main.py
# To run login test, in you directory run: 
     pytest login_test.py

# Previously added code written with help of PyTest to check login page - 'login_test.py'.

# Added some comments so script would be more clear and readable and also improved user experience by providing clear error messages.

# Currently experimenting with Jenkins and DockerHub push
