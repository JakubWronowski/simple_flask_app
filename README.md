# Sample Flask Login Page

# Here I started working on my first Python Website. I will expand it further step by step :).

# To test it run it on your localhost, don't forget 'static' and 'templates' should be in the same directory as main.py
    in your directory run: python3 main.py
# To run login test 
    in your directory run: pytest login_test.py

# Previously added code written with help of PyTest to check login page - 'login_test.py'.

# Added some comments so script would be more clear and readable and also improved user experience by providing clear error messages.
