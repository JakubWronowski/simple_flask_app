# Sample Flask Login Page

# Here I started working on my first Python Website. I will expand it further step by step :).

# Previously added code written with help of PyTest to check login page - 'login_test.py'.

# Added some comments so script would be more clear and readable and also improved user experience by providing clear error messages.
